# 🧠 Subu Design Lab

Welcome to **Subu Design Lab** — a curated collection of low-level designs, system architecture patterns, and backend engineering practices built to sharpen design thinking and showcase scalable engineering.

This repository hub is crafted with a focus on:

- 🔁 Reusability through SOLID principles
- ⚙️ Real-world LLD scenarios and patterns
- 🧱 Clean and modular Java (Spring Boot where applicable)
- 🧪 Testability and extensibility in mind
- 🚀 Readiness for design interviews and production-grade thinking

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each repo in this org is designed to simulate a real-world design scenario or system building block. Projects follow consistent patterns:

- 📄 `README.md` — Clear explanation of problem, approach, design decisions, and extensibility
- 🧱 `model/`, `service/`, `strategy/` — Core domain-driven layers
- 🧪 `test/` — Sample test cases
- 📊 `diagrams/` — Class diagrams or sequence flows (if needed)

## 🎯 Why This Lab Exists

With over a decade of backend engineering experience, I’ve led teams and architected systems across FinTech, HealthTech, and SaaS platforms. This lab reflects my philosophy:

> "**Design is not just about writing code that works, but code that lasts.**"

Each design here aims to be:
- Scalable
- Maintainable
- Easy to explain in interviews or real systems
